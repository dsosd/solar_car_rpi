# About
This code runs on two motherboards, one server and one client. The server, connected to the pi-top, collects data from the client, which should be placed in the solar car. The binaries are flashed onto the motherboards. The new build system is a work in progress, but the original repo utilized the Arduino IDE. The IDE *should* be fine with this code as well, but the new build system does not utilize IDE. The code has been refactored and improved upon with additional features, but there is still a lot more functionality to implement.
